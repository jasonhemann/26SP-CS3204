A *viva* is a short, in-person oral exam where you demonstrate
understanding by explaining ideas out loud, working a small example,
and answering follow-ups. It is not a memory quiz, and not a
code-style review. It is a fast check of what you actually understand.

It will be ~8-10m, in the instructor's office. No notes; you should
expect to use whiteboard or scratch paper to work example, however.
The only required materials would be, for a programming viva, to bring
your own machine if you are expected to run code live.

# Booking

You will book a slot through the Google Calendar link provided in the
assignment. You must book within the window stated in the assignment.
If posted slots do not work, email well in advance to arrange a time;
un-arranged no-shows count as misses.

# What happens in the room

  1. Setup (30 seconds). We confirm the topic and rules.
  2. Your statement (60 seconds). You restate the claim you will establish or the task you will complete.
  3. Mechanism (3 to 4 minutes). You explain give the core idea (e.g. invariant, algorithm, data-structure law).
  4. Concrete instance (2 to 3 minutes). You run through or trace a small example (I may give one, but you should have one ready).
  5. Follow-ups (2 to 3 minutes). Short questions to test variation, edge cases, or transfer. If I need to confirm a decision, I may extend this period.
  6. Decision (under a minute). Pass or redo, with one sentence of guidance.

# Scoring

Depending on the circumstance and course, I will score these differently.

- They may be pass/fail
- There may be some more nuanced rubric
- They may be pass/redo (usually 1 redo option)

## Pass or redo
A pass requires: correctly stated claim, correct mechanism, correctly
working a concrete instance, and coherent answers to follow-ups.

A redo is a chance to fix a specific gap; each viva has one redo
window before a fixed deadline.

## Preparation

Fully grok the material. Be able to explain it in your own words,
contemplate variations on the idea, consider "what if ...?"
alternative hypotheses. Practice with the examples. For algorithms,
formal systems, logics, you should have the rules and operations
memorized. For programming viva, be ready to point at and explain the
exact lines that implement various mechanisms.

## Academic integrity

You may use any resources while preparing. During the viva, no notes
or outside help. Do not share the details of your oral exam with other
students.

For code, you must be the author; if you worked with a partner, you
must still be able to explain the code solo. If you cannot explain
your own work, it does not count.

# Rescheduling and no-shows

You may reschedule up to 12 hours in advance if slots remain. No-shows
without cause count as misses. Make-ups, if granted, must occur within
the assignment's window.

# Accessibility

If you need an accommodation, email early so we can set an alternate
window or format consistent with the assignment.
