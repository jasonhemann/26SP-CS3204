## Preparation

In addition to your book and your notebook, whether you are the
discussion leader or not, you should come prepared with:

- new interesting ideas or novel thoughts you had based upon the reading
- several questions that press on technical or conceptual difficulty,
- several concrete examples or constructions from the text,
- a sense of what this reading sets up rather than resolves, and how it fits into a larger argumentative arc.

## Why This Matters

A seminar only works if someone is responsible for its momentum.
Learning to sustain serious technical discussion is part of the course
and is evaluated accordingly.
