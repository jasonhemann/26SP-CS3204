title: Discussion Leader
layout: single
---

Each student serves once as discussion leader. This role is worth 8
percent of the final grade because it carries real responsibility for
the quality and depth of the seminar on that day.

The discussion leader is not a presenter and not a lecturer. The role
is to ensure that the class spends sustained, careful time unpacking
the assigned material.

## Sign-up

You will be able to sign up on
[this](https://studentshu-my.sharepoint.com/:l:/r/personal/hemannja_shu_edu/Lists/Discussion%20Leader%20Signups?e=gPpd8p)
Microsoft List. Find an available date (not currently taken by someone
else) you would like to present. You will only be allowed to select
one date. Click in the cell under the 'Discussion Leader' column, and
then click beneath the 'Discussion Leader' heading in the pop-up. You
should be able to enter your name or email address. If you've done
this correctly the field will populate with your name and photo.


## Responsibilities

On your assigned day, you are responsible for:

1. **Keeping the discussion moving.**
   If discussion stalls or goes superficial, it is your job to pose
   further questions, redirect attention to the text, or press for
   clarification.

2. **Anchoring discussion in the text.**
   You should be prepared to point to specific definitions, examples,
   or arguments in the reading and bring the class back to them.

3. **Sustaining depth.**
   Rushing through material, skipping difficult points, or settling
   for vague agreement counts against successful leadership.

4. **Engaging the room.**
   You are expected to call on multiple classmates and involve them in
   the discussion. Dead air is your responsibility to address.

5. **Synthesis.**
   At least twice during the class, you should summarize where the
   discussion stands and what has been established so far.

## Evaluation

You will pass if the class spends sustained time on the central ideas
of the reading, with visible engagement and technical detail.

You may fail if discussion is shallow, rushed, unfocused, or repeatedly
stalls without recovery.

Instructor intervention does not count against you, but repeated
intervention to supply questions or restart discussion does.

| Criterion (0–4 each)             | 0 = Missing                                          | 1 = Limited                          | 2 = Basic                                           | 3 = Proficient                                            | 4 = Excellent                                                                                |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Core Outcomes & Focus            | Core aims for today’s reading not surfaced.          | One aim mentioned, not developed.    | States aims but drifts; key pieces underemphasized. | Names the right aims and keeps most time on them.         | Clear, repeated focus; class leaves with the right "takeaways."                              |
| Question Design & Sequencing     | Prompts are vague; discussion stalls or meanders.    | Some prompts land; order is random.  | Mixed: a few strong prompts; sequencing uneven.     | Prompts are specific, text-anchored; logical progression. | Questions build insight step-by-step; smooth pivots on student ideas.                        |
| Time & Flow Management           | Major segments not reached; overruns without triage. | Late pivots; rushes end.             | Acceptable pacing; one segment thin.                | On time for all segments; clear transitions.              | On time plus “triage” skillfully used (drops a sidebar to hit essentials).                   |
| Text Evidence & Boardcraft       | Rarely asks for page/line; no concrete examples.     | Occasional anchoring; board unclear. | Regularly anchors; one worked example attempted*.   | Consistent page/line anchoring; clean board example*.     | Anchors every claim; models concise boardwork* that clarifies the hard part.                 |
| Distribution & Climate           | Same few voices; interruptions unaddressed.          | Some variety; uneven airtime.        | Most students heard; leader nudges politely.        | Broad participation; respectful climate maintained.       | Deliberate equity (on-deck rotation, roles); quiet students invited successfully.            |
| Responsive Teaching (Adaptation) | Ignores confusion; presses on.                       | Notices but can’t course-correct.    | Short clarification or example given.               | Adapts with a quick mini-lesson/exercise that works.      | Turns confusion into a teachable moment without losing focus; quick check for understanding. |

* The boardwork part may not always be relevant, but with formal systems and etc.


### Minute-Milestones (leader hits these or triages intentionally)

By ~10m in: Evoked clearly situated introduction, and offered accepted summarization
By ~35m in: Deep into the heart of the technical matter; at least one concrete example/demonstration, possibly boardwork, and onto a second
By ~50m in: At least into some second fragment of deep technical discussion (could well be further)
By ~60m in: Nearly concluded, synthesis w/2–3 bullet takeaways students can state in their own words.


## What Leadership Is Not

- It is not giving a talk.
- It is not reading prepared notes.
- It is not answering every question yourself.
- It is not deferring responsibility for discussion quality to the
  instructor.

## Preparation

You should come prepared with:
- several questions that press on technical or conceptual difficulty,
- several concrete examples or constructions from the text,
- a sense of what this reading sets up rather than resolves, and how it fits into a larger argumentative arc.

There is no fixed script. You are expected to exercise judgment.


## Why This Matters

A seminar only works if someone is responsible for its momentum.
Learning to sustain serious technical discussion is part of the course
and is evaluated accordingly.
