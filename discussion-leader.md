title: Discussion Leader
layout: single
---

Each student serves ~~once~~ twice as discussion leader. This role is worth 8
percent of the final grade because it carries real responsibility for
the quality and depth of the seminar on that day.

The discussion leader is not a presenter and not a lecturer. The role
is to ensure that the class spends sustained, careful time unpacking
the assigned material.

## Sign-up

Microsoft List. Find an available date (not currently taken by someone
else) you would like to present. ~~You will only be allowed to select
one date.~~ Click in the cell under the 'Discussion Leader' column, and
then click beneath the 'Discussion Leader' heading in the pop-up. You
should be able to enter your name or email address. If you've done
this correctly the field will populate with your name and photo.


## Responsibilities

On your assigned day, you are responsible for:

1. **Keeping the discussion moving.**
   If discussion stalls or goes superficial, it is your job to pose
   further questions, redirect attention to the text, or press for
   clarification.

2. **Anchoring discussion in the text.**
   You should be prepared to point to specific definitions, examples,
   or arguments in the reading and bring the class back to them.

3. **Sustaining depth.**
   Rushing through material, skipping difficult points, or settling
   for vague agreement counts against successful leadership.

4. **Engaging the room.**
   You are expected to call on multiple classmates and involve them in
   the discussion. Dead air is your responsibility to address.

5. **Synthesis.**
   At least twice during the class, you should summarize where the
   discussion stands and what has been established so far.

## Evaluation

These axes assess how the discussion was led, not whether classmates
were fully prepared or gave strong answers. You will pass if the class
spends sustained time on the central ideas of the reading, with
visible engagement and technical detail. You may fail if discussion is
shallow, rushed, unfocused, or repeatedly stalls without recovery.

Instructor intervention does not count against you, but repeated
intervention to supply questions or restart discussion does.

### Minute-Milestones (leader hits these or triages intentionally)

- **By ~10m in**: Evoked clearly situated introduction, and offered accepted summarization
- **By ~35m in**: Deep into the heart of the technical matter; at least one concrete example/demonstration, possibly boardwork, and onto a second
- **By ~50m in**: At least into some second fragment of deep technical discussion (could well be further)
- **By ~60m in**: Nearly concluded, synthesis w/2-3 bullet takeaways students can state in their own words.


## What Leadership Is Not

- It is not giving a talk.
- It is not reading prepared notes.
- It is not answering every question yourself.
- It is not deferring responsibility for discussion quality to the
  instructor.

## Preparation

You should come prepared with:
- several questions that press on technical or conceptual difficulty,
- several concrete examples or constructions from the text,
- a sense of what this reading sets up rather than resolves, and how it fits into a larger argumentative arc.

There is no fixed script. You are expected to exercise judgment.


## Why This Matters

A seminar only works if someone is responsible for its momentum.
Learning to sustain serious technical discussion is part of the course
and is evaluated accordingly.
