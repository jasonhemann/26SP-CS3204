    title: Core Outcomes and Focus
    levels:
      - "Core aims for the reading are not surfaced."
      - "One aim is mentioned, but undeveloped or vague."
      - "Major aims are stated, but discussion drifts or key aspects are underemphasized."
      - "Major aims (more than one possible) are surfaced and most discussion time stays on them."
      - "Clear, repeated focus; class leaves with major takeaways that can be stated in their own words."

  - id: question-design-and-sequencing
    title: Question Design and Sequencing
    levels:
      - "Prompts are vague or absent; discussion stalls or meanders."
      - "Some prompts land, but sequencing is random or reactive."
      - "A few strong prompts appear; sequencing is uneven."
      - "Prompts are specific and text-anchored; questions progress logically and keep discussion moving, even when a student struggles."
      - "Questions build insight step by step; leader pivots smoothly on student contributions and uses brief recap or low-stakes prompts to maintain momentum."

  - id: time-and-flow-management
    title: Time and Flow Management
    levels:
      - "Major segments are not reached; time is mismanaged."
      - "Late pivots; end is rushed or incomplete."
      - "Acceptable pacing, but one major segment is thin or compressed."
      - "All major segments are reached; transitions are clear."
      - "Time is managed deliberately; secondary threads are explicitly deferred to maintain focus on essentials."

  - id: text-evidence-and-boardcraft
    title: Text Evidence and Boardcraft
    levels:
      - "Discussion is untethered from the text; no concrete examples."
      - "Occasional reference to the text; examples or boardwork are unclear."
      - "Regular textual anchoring; at least one concrete example or construction attempted."
      - "Consistent page or line anchoring; clear example or boardwork when appropriate."
      - "Every major claim is anchored; concise boardwork or examples clarify the hardest point."

  - id: distribution-and-climate
    title: Distribution and Climate
    levels:
      - "Same few voices dominate; interruptions or dead air go unaddressed."
      - "Some variety of voices, but airtime is uneven."
      - "Most students are heard; leader nudges politely."
      - "Broad participation; respectful climate; quiet students are invited using short prompts or recap questions; discussion continues when someone flounders."
      - "Deliberate equity; wide variety of voices over time; leader redirects or reframes smoothly when a student is unprepared, without loss of momentum."

  - id: responsive-teaching-adaptation
    title: Responsive Teaching (Adaptation)
    levels:
      - "Confusion is ignored; leader presses on regardless."
      - "Confusion is noticed but not resolved."
      - "A brief clarification or example is offered."
      - "Leader adapts with a short explanation, example, or reframing that works."
      - "Confusion becomes a teachable moment; leader checks understanding and reorients discussion without losing focus."
