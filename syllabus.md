This syllabus contains policies and expectations I have established
for {{ site.title }}. Please read carefully the entire syllabus before
continuing in this course. Policies and expectations as set forth in this syllabus
may be modified at any time by the course instructor. Notice of such
changes will be made by announcement in class, by written or email
notice, or by changes to this syllabus posted on the course website.


## Overview

Some infinities can't be counted. Some programs cannot be written. For
any reasonable theory, there are arithmetical truths it cannot prove.
With the tools of formal systems, finite beings can perceive limits on
what finite beings can do and know.

This course is a book-club style seminar on Gödel, Escher, Bach (GEB).
Nearly all assessment happens in the room: brief reading quizzes,
discussion leadership, and extensive participation. There will however
be some light programming exercises, demonstrations, short vivas, and
some out of class exercises.

---

## Required Textbooks

- Douglas Hofstadter, "Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid" (any edition).

- Ernest Nagel & James Newman, "Gödel's Proof" (revised ed., NYU Press).

---

## Course Outcomes

By the end of the course you will be able to:

   1. Use precise language to reason *inside* and *about* formal systems.
   2. Present and lead discussion from a difficult text. Frame claims, surface objections, land a one-sentence takeaway; keep conversation grounded in the assigned chapter(s).
   3. Explain meta-programming and implement meta-programming.
   4. Explain Gödel's first incompleteness theorem in plain English.
   5. Articulate why halting is undecidable and why the busy beaver outruns every computable growth rate.
   6. Practice the habits a seminar like this demands: careful reading of technical prose; step-wise informal justification; and clear, short board explanations.

---

## Format

- Seminar, not lecture. First ~8 minutes: reading quiz; the rest is discussion and short technique blocks.
- This is a discussion course. You're expected to participate almost daily (questions, claims tied to text, challenges). I will cold-call as I feel warranted. If your participation is low over two consecutive meetings, expect a check-in.
- Minimal coding, with live grading of individual explanations.
- Check-offs are live and individual. Group coding is fine; the explanation is solo.

---

## Evaluation & Grading

- Reading Quizzes --- 40%

- Participation & Leadership --- 25%
  - Seminar participation (15): regular, text-tied contributions (tracked).
  - Discussion leader (8): once.
  - Professionalism (2): prepared, on time, no disruptions.

- Office-Hour Orals --- 20 pts (two vivas, 10+10; pass/redo)
  - Weeks 4-5 on formal systems, invariants, and enumerability
  - Week 9 on fixed-points or recursion-theorem

- 1# Micro-Check-offs --- 5 pts

  Show `self` plus one variant (`self#`, `#self`, or `self2`); 90-second explanation.

- Universal 1# Demo --- 10 pts (pairs; in-room)
  Two-week build once assigned; live run of `U(P,X)` on: (1) trivial P; (2) `write`; (3) a quine. Answer two "why" questions.

**Non-negotiable: You must pass Day-1 Logic Diagnostic, Oral A, and Oral B to pass the course, regardless of points.**

Late/make-ups. In-room work has windows, no extensions. For cause, you'll be offered the next available window, or take the opportunity to organize a swap with another student.

---

## Reading Quizzes (mechanics)

- Closed book; short answers only; 6–8 minutes.
- Confidence box per item starts Week 2
- Drop 3 quizzes automatically. Your quiz grade is the percentage over the reduced denominator times 40.

---

## Office-Hour Orals (details)

Format (both orals): 8-10 minutes; no notes; board welcome. You state
the claim, give the mechanism (invariant / mapping / fixed-point), and
answer follow-ups. Scored pass/redo on: core correctness, mechanism
clarity, precision of language, Q&A. One redo window per oral.

---

## TRM / 1# Project

We'll follow a series of lessons about the one-hash (1#) language:

 1. Basics
 2. Programs-for-Programs (`write`, `s1^1`)
 3. Self-replication (`diag`, `self`)
 4. Universal 1#.

Exact spec/encoding + meta-language generator will be posted with the assignment. Live check-offs only.

---

## Policies

- Academic integrity. Discuss readings freely; quizzes are individual. For 1#, collaboration on ideas is fine; you must be able to explain your own code live. Failure to explain = zero.
- Use of AI tools. Allowed for prep/brainstorming. Disclose any AI assistance in one line on code/prompts. Understanding is verified in the room; no detectors.
- Devices & recording. Laptops/tablets are forbidden in class, and phones away. Recording requires prior permission.
- Attendance. This is a seminar; absence means lost participation and quiz. If you're ill or have accommodations, email before class.

---

## Participation

I expect you to attend each lecture. Attendance is a prerequisite for
participation, a substantial portion of your grade for this course. I
expect students to attend every class and remain in class throughout
the duration of the session. Your absence or tardiness will impact
your ability to achieve course objectives which could hurt your course
grade. An absence, excused or unexcused, does not relieve a student of
any course requirement. Lecture content quizzes serve as proxies for
participation and thus attendance, as well as to gauge students'
understanding.


## Contact

The best way to get in contact for personal, private (FERPA, etc)
messages is via my email address
[{{ site.author.emailaddr }}]({{ site.author.email }}). You should expect a
response within 48 hours.

### Course evaluations

I encourage students to take time and submit Course evaluations. Your
time is busy at the end of the term when these are available. In order
to fairly compensate you for that time without violating the integrity
or anonymity of the system, if 85% or more of the enrolled students
complete these Course evaluations, then I shall add a point onto the
class-wide final average.

## Academic Accommodations

It is the policy and practice of Seton Hall University to promote
inclusive learning environments. If you have a documented disability
you may be eligible for reasonable accommodations in compliance with
University policy, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act, and/or the New Jersey Law against
Discrimination. Please note, students are not permitted to negotiate
accommodations directly with professors. To request accommodations or
assistance, please self-identify with the Office for Disability
Support Services (DSS), Duffy Hall, Room 67 at the beginning of the
semester. For more information or to register for services, contact
DSS at (973) 313-6003 or by [e-mail](mailto:DSS@shu.edu), or visit
their [webpage](https://www.shu.edu/disability-support-services/index.cfm).

## Equity and Compliance

One of our responsibilities in supporting student learning 360° is to
help create a safe learning environment both in person and virtually.
You should carefully consult the university's [relevant information
and policies](https://www.shu.edu/title-ix/index.cfm), and if you have
or experience any violations of the above I encourage you to take full
advantage of the university resources.

It is also important that you know that federal regulations and
University policy require me to promptly convey any information about
certain kinds of misconduct known to me to our Title IX Coordinator.
In that event, they will work with a small number of others on campus
to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and resources are made
available to the student who may have been harmed. Protecting a
student's privacy is of utmost concern, and all involved will only
share information with those that need to know to ensure the
University can respond and assist.
